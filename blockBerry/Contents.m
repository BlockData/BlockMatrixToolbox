% BLOCKBERRY
%
%   Toolbox for manipulation of Block-Matrices.
%
%   Data classes:
%   BlockMatrix         - Matrix that can be divided into several blocks
%   BlockDiagonal       - Block Matrix with zeros blocks except on diagonal blocks
%
%   Representation of block dimensions:
%   BlockDimensions     - Store the block dimensions of a BlockMatrix data structure
%   IntegerPartition    - Store an ordered partition of an integer
%
%   Utility classes:
%   AbstractBlockMatrix - Utility class parent of BlockMatrix and BlockDiagonal 
%
%   Demo files:
%   demoBlockDiagonal   - Simple demo file for manipulation of BlockDiagonal objects
%   demoBlockMatrix     - Simple demo file for manipulation of BlockMatrix objects
%   maxbet_procedure1   - MAXBET procedure for multi-block matrices.
